# Core Runtime Integration

This directory contains the core Bun runtime integration that serves as the foundation for Polyglot.

## Components

- **Runtime Manager**: Manages loading and initialization of language runtimes
- **Memory Manager**: Handles unified memory model and reference counting
- **IPC Bridge**: High-performance communication between webview and runtime
- **Type System**: Cross-language type definitions and validation
- **Event Loop**: Coordinates async operations across language boundaries

## Architecture

The core runtime builds on Bun's native TypeScript support and N-API for native extension loading. It provides:

1. **Language Runtime Loading**: Dynamic loading of enabled language runtimes
2. **Memory Isolation**: Each runtime operates in its own memory space
3. **Shared Memory Access**: Controlled sharing of ArrayBuffers and TypedArrays
4. **Type Safety**: Automatic TypeScript definition generation
5. **Performance Monitoring**: Profiling and debugging across languages

## Implementation Status

ðŸš§ **Planning Phase** - Core architecture design in progress.
